## Algebra Sandbox

This is an extremely simple [computer algebra system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system).

It's mainly intended to be a tool for playing with algebra and symbolic manipulation, and a jumping off point for developing your own CAS.

Operator support: +, -, *, /, ^

TODO:
- Allow arbitrary pronumeral usage
- Equality support
- Input LaTeX strings in input field
- "Set" vs "Modify" operators to input a new statement vs modifying an existing one
- "Isolate" function to rearrange equalities with single pronumeral on one side
